The SAP Signavio Academic Models (SAP-SAM) dataset contains hundreds of thousands of business process models (as well as other business models, such as business decision models and value chains) that have been created over the course of more than a decade by the SAP Signavio BPM Academic Initiative. Detailed instructions on how to work with the dataset, as well as example scripts, are available on GitHub at https://github.com/signavio/sap-sam.
